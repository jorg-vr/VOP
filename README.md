### [Commit style](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

**A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:**

    If applied, this commit will your subject line here

For example:

    If applied, this commit will *refactor subsystem X for readability*
    If applied, this commit will *update getting started documentation*
    If applied, this commit will *remove deprecated methods*

Notice how this doesn’t work for the other non-imperative forms:

    If applied, this commit will *fixed bug with Y*
    If applied, this commit will *changing behavior of X*
    If applied, this commit will *more fixes for broken stuff*

*Remember: Use of the imperative is important only in the subject line. You can relax this restriction when you’re writing the body.*

#### For example:
    Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

    Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
    are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
    Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
    change? Here's the place to explain them.

    Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

    - Bullet points are okay, too

    - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
    by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
    vary here

    If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
    like this:

    Resolves: #123
    See also: #456, #789
